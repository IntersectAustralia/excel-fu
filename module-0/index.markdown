This course is structured as a series of modules.

In modules 1 and 2 we'll import some daily weather data from the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/). We'll import it, sanity check it and then explore and chart the data. We'll cover:

* downloading datasets from the web.
* good file naming conventions.
* importing comma separated values (CSV) data into Excel.
* joining data from multiple imported files into one larger table.
* quickly checking over data by seeing if it fits with our expectations and estimations.
* copying data to preserve an unmodified copy of the dataset.
* distinguishing metadata from the data itself.

* using ```MIN```, ```MAX```, and ```AVERAGE``` functions.
* formatting for clarity, freezing panes, and hiding rows.
* conditional formatting for assessing data at a glance.
* sparklines for bite size charts.
* sorting and filtering data.
* using PivotTables for aggregating data
* using "Paste Special" to get a clean copy of the data, without formulas.
* using the ```VLOOKUP``` function to map values.
* creating a basic "polar" chart aka "radar" chart.

In modules 3 and 4, we'll delve further into the weather data, looking at historical daily data for Sydney since records began in 1859. We'll cover:

* getting the historical data from the BOM.
* importing the data into Excel.
* quickly seeing if the amount of data imported matches our expectations.
* more advanced PivotTable usage.
* working around issues with PivotTable data to make it easy to plot.
* tips for quickly removing blank rows.
* working with dates.
* named ranges and why they're a good thing.
* plotting time series data.
* making plots pretty.

In modules 5 and 6 we'll acquire some data from a separate source, Geoscience Austalia. In this case we'll get computed sunrise and sunset times. These come in a format that's easy for humans to read but terrible for a machine to read. But with Excel, we'll find a way! We'll cover:

* getting the data from Geoscience Australia.
* getting data from a web page into Excel.
* separating metadata from data.
* using the "fixed width" import option to break data into columns.
* more working with dates.
* converting strings (text) into times Excel can work with.
* how Excel stores dates and times internally.
* subtracting times
* quick sanity checks based on what we know about sunrise, sunset and the seasons.

Module 7 builds on modules 3, 4, 5 and 6. In this module we put it all together, by combining our historical weather data with our sunrise and sunset data to look at the correlation between day length and temperature. We'll explore:

* pulling in data from multiple spreadsheets.
* presenting data on a common plot.

Lastly, we present a section called "Where to next?", that offers suggestions for digging further into Excel and other tools that you may also find useful.

This course assumes basic knowledge of Excel, including:

* the general Office/Excel interface (menus, ribbons/toolbars, etc.)
* workbooks and [worksheets](http://www.excel-easy.com/basics/worksheets.html)
* [absolute and relative references](http://web.pdx.edu/~stipakb/CellRefs.htm), e.g. ```$A$1```, ```A1```.
* simple [ranges](http://www.excel-easy.com/introduction/range.html), e.g. ```A1:B5```

The course was compiled using Microsoft Excel 2011 for Mac. There are many versions of Excel in use. Some features used here may not be available in all versions. Also, the way in which they are accessed may differ from version to version. If the instructions don't make sense for your version of Excel, try a web search with some keywords and your Excel version, e.g. [Excel 2010 pivot tables](https://www.google.com.au/?q=Excel+2010+pivot+tables). Generally, the concepts covered will be applicable even if the steps are slightly different for your copy of Excel.
